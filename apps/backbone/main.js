/**
 * BackBone — application code.
 *
 * The standalone app's 9,172-line inline <script>, ported. What changed:
 *
 *   1. 455 LINES DELETED — the login gate, session check, user and role
 *      management, and applyTabVisibility(). The shell signs people in and the
 *      rail is the nav, so all of it belonged to the shell now. Tab visibility
 *      in particular had to go: it manipulated .nav-btn elements that no longer
 *      exist.
 *
 *   2. ALL 12 fetch() CALLS go through ctx.api. The seam returns parsed data
 *      and throws on a non-2xx, so each `if (!r.ok) ... await r.json()` became
 *      a try/catch. Three sites needed more than a swap:
 *        - loadLeads keeps its hard-won guarantee that a failed request never
 *          empties the list. A past bug did exactly that and twenty real leads
 *          vanished with no error.
 *        - The Printavo sync keeps the error BODY, because that endpoint
 *          returns saved progress alongside a timeout 500 and discarding it
 *          would restart the whole history sync.
 *        - /api/brief distinguishes a 404 from a credentials failure, which are
 *          very different fixes.
 *
 *   3. 230 DOM LOOKUPS scoped to the app's own root via $id/$one/$all. Several
 *      apps are mounted at once, so a document-wide search could reach into
 *      another app's markup. Three document uses remain deliberately: a drag
 *      listener that must catch mouseup anywhere, and a temporary download link.
 *
 *   4. WINDOW GLOBALS namespaced. Five functions are reached from inline
 *      onclick in generated markup and now hang off one `BackBone` object
 *      rather than five bare names on window.
 *
 *   5. THE NAV became showView(), which the shell calls on every route change.
 *
 * Everything else — the scoring, the dashboard layout, the lead qualification,
 * the tier maths — is unchanged.
